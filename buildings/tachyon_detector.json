  "description": "Access to highly coveted cloaking technology from the Romulan and Klingon Empires is now more widely available. As a result, most R&D teams and defense specialists have been working on effective countermeasures. The latest attempt to expose cloaked vessels is the Tachyon Detector, a device that floods nearby space with temporary bursts of tachyon radiation in an attempt to disrupt the cloak and make ships visible to sensors once again.",
