  "description": "Ilmatar was one of the first systems of the Vaaran Expanse to show intelligent, native life. Though not yet warp capable, several fledgling civilizations have popped up on less than friendly planets throughout the system. It is surprising that the natives have survived this long, as Ilmatar suffers regularly from deadly anomalies and asteroid showers.",
