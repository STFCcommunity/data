  "description": "Tera Lara has some of the highest concentrations of dark matter ever recorded in a single star system. While dark matter makes up 85% of all space, it is rare to find a sample with greater density than a single proton mass for every three cubic meters. In Tera Lara, samples of Dark Matter have had a density rating almost triple that, which may contribute to the alarming frequency of subspace tears in the region.",
