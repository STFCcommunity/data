  "description": "The Corvallen have taken an early interest in the Origin Sector on behalf of the Romulan Star Empire, under direct order of the Praetor. As the Romulans hold their line in the war against the Federation and the Klingons, they have entrusted expansion into this lucrative region to their most technologically advanced allies. The Corvallen see Progenitor technology and resources as the future of intergalactic civilization, and have placed themselves at the forefront of this exciting frontier.",
