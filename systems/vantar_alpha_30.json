  "description": "The nomadic Suliban have been unified under the banner of the Romulan Empire. Now a stable and prosperous regime under their superpower allies, the Suliban seek even greater fortune in the scramble for Isogen, and Progenitor technologies. Their paranoid distrust of fellow Romulan allies like the Corvallen has driven the Suliban to ensure that the best interests of their collected alliance are served. Thus they have committed considerable force to a claim in the Origin Sector.",
