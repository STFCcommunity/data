  "description": "The Bolians have been a member of the Federation for a long time, but their hunger for exploration has been given a back seat in recent years, due to the ongoing war between the Federation, the Klingons, and the Romulans. The Origin Sector has given a subsection of the Bolian people a new sense of ambition, as they hope to bring Progenitor secrets and advancements back home. The Bolians were quick to move into this region and have made a bargain with the mighty Breen Confederacy in order to maintain their hold.",
