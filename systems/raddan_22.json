  "description": "Raddan is home to some of the Vaara Expanse's wildest inhabitants. Roving bands of native hostiles seek to pillage any errant vessels that find themselves in this strange, inhospitable space. For this reason, and partly because of the regular solar flares from the system\u2019s sun, the Raddan system has never been fully colonized.",
