  "description": "In the late 2100s, a disastrous warp engine experiment left human scientist Charles Rainsford stranded in unknown territory. While his foray into astronautical engineering was a failure, Charles had made quite the discovery, a whole new region of space itself. He returned with news of this fascinating new expanse to be explored, only to be deemed a fraud by Federation authorities. With his reputation ruined, Charles never did make it back to Rainsford, but it bears his name to this day.",
