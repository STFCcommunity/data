  "description": "Lydan was first discovered by a group of refugees in 2135. After a vicious attack on their homeworld, they fled to warp without a fully functioning navigation computer. Their ship ended up floating through this tumultuous space. Though it was an incredibly hard life, the refugees eventually managed to settle and tame a planet in Lydan, where a small colony lives to this day.",
