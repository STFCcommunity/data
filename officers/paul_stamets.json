  "description": "When, in generations to come, students at Starfleet Academy study the brightest minds in Federation history, one name will stand out from all others; Paul Stamets.\n\nA genius in every sense of the word, Stamets rose through the ranks of Starfleet based on his masteries of biology, physics and quantum mechanics. He, along with a beloved friend, created technologies that would propel Starfleet to even greater heights, but none more so than his patented Spore Drive.\n\nWhen the war started, this marvelous technology was co-opted by Starfleet and pressed into service against the Klingons. Stamets loathed the idea of his creation being mishandled by incompetent warmongers and so insisted on managing the technology himself.\n\nSince then, he has seen the Discovery through countless unwinnable battles and treacherous situations, always counting on his brilliant mind to carry them to victory.",
