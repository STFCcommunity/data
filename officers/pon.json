  "description": "Few species in the Alpha Quadrant are as mysterious, as entirely unplaceable, as the Breen. In their eerie refrigeration suits, the Breen\u2019s soldiers take on an almost supernatural visage, an image of alien invaders from old Earth holotapes.\nWhat little is known about the Breen tells us that they are ruthless in combat, and boast some of the most powerful ships in the quadrant. The secret to their power is unknown, but we can be sure that to rise the ranks in the Breen military requires cunning, unmatched skill and unwavering ruthlessness.",
