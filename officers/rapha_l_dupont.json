  "description": "The Dupont name carries with it an immense weight. Socialites, artists, leaders. In France, the Dupont name is royalty.\nSo it is fair to say that Rapha\u00ebl Dupont, second son of esteemed artist Aumier Dupont, had something of an advantage over his peers.\nGiven the best education his father could provide, Rapha\u00ebl proved to be something of a prodigy of mathematics. His grasp of thermodynamics and theoretical physics would earn him high praise in the academic field. However, he quickly grew bored of the endless stream of peer reviews and university lectures. He found himself enthralled by tales of material miners beyond Federation space. He longed for the danger, the adrenaline, the freedom! But instead, he was stuck on Earth, bound by Federation laws and regulation. He had had enough. It was time for him to forge his own path.\nStealing away one dark night with his family\u2019s prized starship under his possession, he took off beyond the stars, seeking fortune and the adventure of a lifetime.",
