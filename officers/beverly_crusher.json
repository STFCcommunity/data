  "description": "As the Chief Medical Officer on the USS Enterprise-D, Doctor Beverly Crusher balances her renowned booksmarts with a strong sense of empathy for all those she treats. Furthermore, she also acts as something of a mother figure and unofficial therapist for the rest of the Enterprise crew, her reputation for being a great listener and giving out insightful advice preceding her.\nHowever, even with her usually gentle and caring nature, there is a steel inside Dr. Crusher that has allowed her to step up into a leadership role when needed. Able to make the tough decisions, and commanding the respect of those around her, Doctor Crusher has even helped the Enterprise crew survive a Borg attack through her quick thinking and decisive actions.",
