  "description": "\u201cSo I heard these mooks in the city saying somewhere out there it\u2019s the 25th century or some cockamamie crazy talk like that, but right here, right now, in the real world, it\u2019s 1941 and the future - heck, any kind of future - well, it looks a long, long way away to me. Sure I got my dreams, we all got our dreams, of a bright new tomorrow, of a shining metropolis of wonders like in the moving pictures, but none of that ain\u2019t gonna happen until I clean the dirty streets of today.\n\nSan Francisco is a cesspool of sleaze and crime, a town overrun by gangsters and the corrupt politicians in their pockets, where every second knock at my door is some dame looking to settle a score or mend a broken heart, like I\u2019m the answer to all their problems. Hell, what do I know? Maybe I am. All I can say for sure is that I do the best I can. You need help? You can find me in the book. The name\u2019s Dixon Hill. Detective for hire.\u201d",
