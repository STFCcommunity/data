  "description": "Keenser is the first Roylan to enter Starfleet, and is an excellent engineer. By Roylan standards, he is abnormally tall; this made him the target of ridicule on his home world. He learned that stoicism was the best method of dealing with bullies, and has since become remarkably laconic. Never the less, his skills have made him a regular on the Enterprise, and is one of Scotty's most dependable friends.",
