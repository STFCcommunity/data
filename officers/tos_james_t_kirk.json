  "description": "Explorer. Diplomat. Hero. \nJames Tiberius Kirk has been called many things, but most just call him... Captain.\nBorn in Iowa on Earth in 2233, Kirk was raised by his loving parents; George and Winona Kirk. Their teachings, in particular those of his father, inspired a young Kirk to enlist in Starfleet.\nThough he had some blemishes on his record from certain events in the Academy, Kirk proved himself as a reliable man with a noble spirit.\nKirk was a natural leader and quickly climbed the ranks as a Starfleet officer. After a tour of duty aboard the USS Farragut, Kirk found himself assigned to Starfleet\u2019s most prolific vessel; The USS Enterprise. In 2265, at the age of thirty-two, Kirk was granted command of the Enterprise from Captain Pike. It was the proudest day of his father\u2019s life.\nKirk went on to serve with distinction. Under his steadfast leadership, the Enterprise has survived wars, natural disasters, time travel and near galactic destruction. They became legends.\nThroughout it all, Kirk has never lost sight of his childhood dream. To explore, to see new worlds and meet new civilizations... To boldly go, where no-one has gone before.",
