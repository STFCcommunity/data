  "description": "Explorer. Diplomat. Hero. \nJames Tiberius Kirk has been called many things, but most just call him... Captain.\nBorn in Iowa on Earth in 2233, Kirk was raised by his loving parents; George and Winona Kirk. Their teachings, in particular those of his father, inspired a young Kirk to enlist in Starfleet.\nThough he had some blemishes on his record from certain events in the Academy, Kirk proved himself as a reliable man with a noble spirit.\nKirk was a natural leader and quickly climbed the ranks as a Starfleet officer. After a tour of duty aboard the USS Farragut, Kirk found himself assigned to Starfleet\u2019s most prolific vessel; The USS Enterprise. In 2265, at the age of thirty-two, Kirk was granted command of the Enterprise from Captain Pike. It was the proudest day of his father\u2019s life.",
