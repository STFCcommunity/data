  "description": "A self-proclaimed embodiment of modern medicine, The Doctor is the Emergency Medical Hologram and chief medical officer of the Federation starship Voyager. When Voyager was abducted by a being known as the Caretaker and transported over 70,000 lightyears away to the Delta Quadrant, the crew endured heavy casualties; the ship\u2019s chief physician among them. This tragic loss would result in The Doctor\u2019s activation by Ensign Harry Kim. Although originally intended for short-term activation, Voyager\u2019s precarious situation and isolation so far from home would see The Doctor promoted to full-time service as the new chief physician.\nDespite enduring a perilous journey home, The Doctor has developed a sophisticated array of emotions and interests. From brief indulgences in creative writing to practicing classical Italian opera, The Doctor\u2019s pursuits and hobbies have helped him to break free from the confines of the matrices and subroutines that should have defined him. Subsequently, The Doctor would become a remarkable and valued member of the crew, earning the respect of his peers and friendship of his colleagues in the process.",
