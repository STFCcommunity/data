  "description": "Home is a difficult concept for those who live in two worlds.\n\nBa\u2019el is the daughter of a Romulan and a Klingon, a living contrast who never knew the reality of life outside of her peaceful commune. She was content to live a simple, quiet life with her family and friends, far from the worries of the galaxy.\n\nThat was, until she met Worf.\n\nBa\u2019el immediately fell in love with this strange Starfleet officer, though it was not fully reciprocated. Even when her family turned on him, when her people were ready to kill him, she stood by his side. It was thanks to her that Worf made it back to the Enterprise in one piece.\n\nLoyal, determined and with a will of iron, Ba\u2019el shows the best qualities of both Romulans and Klingons.",
