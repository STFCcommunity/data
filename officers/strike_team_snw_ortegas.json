  "description": "Erica Ortegas completed combat training at Starfleet Academy with full honors, and identifies the phaser rifle as her preferred ground combat weapon. Ortegas is adept at a range of hand-to-hand disciplines and as part of her induction to flight combat modules, was known for her speed and agility. Despite her natural talent, her favored area of expertise is in piloting, where she is known as the first choice helm officer on the Federation\u2019s flagship, the USS Enterprise.\n\nAs a supremely confident officer, Ortegas likes to show some flair when at the helm. She has devised many tactical flight maneuvers, many of which share her name. It is her desire and expectation that one way or another, the name Ortegas will live on in Starfleet history.",
