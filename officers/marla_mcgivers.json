  "description": "Marla McGivers was one of Starfleet\u2019s top historians and a specialist in the late-20th century Eugenics Wars. This put her in a rather unique position; she is one of the only people in the galaxy to know of Khan\u2019s true history.\n\nMarla was appalled by Starfleet\u2019s treatment of Khan during his trial and subsequent sentencing. To her, Khan was the greatest discovery in the history of the Federation. Shortly after Khan was imprisoned once more, Marla handed in her resignation. She couldn\u2019t possibly stay with an organization that would spit in the face of discovery.\n\nMarla now works with the Augments, attempting to act as their link to modern humanity. As the only one of them who truly understands this new galaxy, Marla has proven herself a valuable ally to the Augments.",
