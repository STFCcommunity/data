  "description": "Responsibility for the security of an actively serving ship and its company would prove to be no small task for Lieutenant La\u2019an Noonien-Singh, Chief of Security of the USS Enterprise. As a child, she was the lone survivor of an attack on her homeworld, resulting in the loss of friends and family alike. Alone among the stars and with nobody else to turn to, La\u2019an soon learned from a young age how to survive on her own and become self-sufficient. Now, finding herself among the ranks of Captain Pike\u2019s stalwart crew, La\u2019an has discovered an apt role in which to claim respite from the burden of isolation. Through her capacity as Chief of Security, La\u2019an has chosen to share her skills and teachings with fellow officers. By training and honing the skills of individual officers, La\u2019an has also strengthened the capabilities of the crew as a whole.\n\nRegardless of her Augment heritage, or perhaps in spite of it, La\u2019an remains staunchly opposed to all facets of genetic engineering. However, being a descendant of the great Khan will forever link her name to these practices. Realizing that one will never be able to escape the bonds of their heritage, La\u2019an has instead decided to stop running and establish an identity of her own.",
