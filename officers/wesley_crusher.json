  "description": "Wesley Crusher is a gifted young officer with the hopes of one day becoming a leader within the ranks of the Federation. As the son of the USS Enterprise\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Doctor Beverly Crusher, Wesley has grown up almost exclusively on starships. Despite his young age, Crusher has been recognized as a remarkable talent for science and navigation, and was given the rank of Acting-Ensign so that he could have first-hand bridge experience prior to his acceptance to Starfleet Academy.\n\nWesley\u2019s father, Jack Crusher, lost his life on an away mission when the boy was only five years old. Growing up without his father has meant that Wesley has become an independent thinker, one who has many role models among the crew that works around him. He has a special attachment to Captain Picard himself, and many of the other bridge officers on the Enterprise.",
