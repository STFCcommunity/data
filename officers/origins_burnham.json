  "description": "A true prodigy, Commander Michael Burnham was raised by Ambassador Sarek on the Vulcan homeworld. She was intended to act as a bridge between Vulcan and human societies, a living testament to the potential of both species. Unfortunately, anti-human bias among the elite prevented Michael from ascending as far as she deserved.\n\nCrestfallen, Michael elected instead to enlist in Starfleet, where she was put under the command of one Captain Phillipa Georgiou, of the USS Shenzhou. Burnham and Georgiou formed a strong bond, and Michael eventually earned a place at Captain Georgiou's right hand, as her first officer.",
