  "description": "This Changeling operative was working in secret to infiltrate the Federation, having planted itself as an imposter on Deep Space Nine. \n\nOriginating from The Great Link, the Changelings, or Founders, are a deeply secretive race, known as the rulers of the Dominion, a galactic civilization that spans much of the Gamma Quadrant.\n\nChangeling can take the form of other individuals, or even objects, and are extremely difficult to detect. Little is known about this particular Changeling operative, other than the fact that she escaped capture by Starfleet and is now once again out in the wild.",
