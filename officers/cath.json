  "description": "The typical role of the female in Ferengi culture is one of subjugation and opperssion. Driven by patriarchal laws and cultural standards, Ferengi society highly discouraged females from the persuit of profit or independence. While compliance with these norms was commonplace, a number of Ferengi women throughout history have absconded from their expected roles in Ferengi society, and have instead opted to pursue their own aspirations and desires. Albeit later in life, Cath would eventually join their ranks with her own story to tell.",
