  "description": "They say a Captain is only as good as his First Officer. If that is indeed the case, then Captain Kirk can rest easy knowing that his First Officer is one of the finest in the galaxy.\nSpock, a given name as his full name is unpronounceable to humans, is a human/Vulcan hybrid born on Vulcan in 2230. His hybrid status caused him no shortage of pain in his childhood, but the love of his mother and the wisdom of his father allowed him to overcome his aggressors.\nA prodigy even by Vulcan standards, Spock was destined for greatness. He was even granted a place in the prestigious Vulcan Science Academy, which he declined in favor of Starfleet.\nHe was granted a place on the Enterprise, where he served as Captain Pike\u2019s Science Officer. He forged a close relationship with his Captain and was intended to eventually take over command of the vessel.",
