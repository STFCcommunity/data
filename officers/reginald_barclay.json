  "description": "Not all are destined to make history. \nReginald Barclay may be the subject of derision from his crewmates on the Enterprise-D, due to his nervous behavior and reclusive personality, but behind that awkward mask lies the mind of a brilliant engineer.\nSo great was Barclay\u2019s talents and determination that he managed to overcome a list of fears and complexes to find himself assigned to Starfleet\u2019s flagship. The admiralty saw something in him, and they were not wrong... mostly.\nAn expert in holographic technology and quantum mechanics, Barclay became synonymous with the ship\u2019s Holodeck. From keeping the crew\u2019s favorite pastime technology ticking, to performing crucial repairs on the flagship\u2019s systems, Barclay consistently proved himself to be an irreplaceable, consistent asset to the crew.",
