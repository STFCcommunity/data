  "description": "Fearless warrior. A man of two worlds.\n\nWorf, son of Mogh, is a Klingon warrior and Starfleet officer. At a young age, Worf lived on the Khitomer colony, which was eventually attacked by Romulan forces, leaving him orphaned. Luckily, he was rescued by a Federation vessel, the USS Intrepid, where he was adopted by the Rozhenko family. Worf grew up surrounded by humans, but kept close ties to his ancestral home. As the first of his kind to ever serve in Starfleet, he has constantly faced ridicule and rejection from fellow Klingons. Worf fights twice as hard for his honor, and has become a battle-sharpened edge as a result.\n\nWorf\u2019s place as Chief Security aboard the Enterprise came after a stint as conn officer. He regularly reports to away team duty as the front line of defense for the landing party. Worf is a fearless and formidable warrior, with a bat\u2019leth, or helming the tactical controls of a starship.",
