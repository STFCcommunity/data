  "description": "One of the last of the Mirani alien race, Tiza and the other Mirani were forced out of their territory a century ago by Eclipse, who took over that area to create the Exchange. \n\nA handful of survivors managed to escape, building new lives for themselves on previously deserted planets. While most records of the Mirani have since been wiped out by Eclipse, they were known as technological pioneers in their prime, and that talent has been passed on to the new generation of Mirani, including Tiza. \n\nNow, as the leader of the remaining Mirani, Tiza believes it\u2019s time to take back their systems from Eclipse.",
