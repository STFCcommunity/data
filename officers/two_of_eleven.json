  "description": "The vast majority of those who make up the overwhelming numbers of the Borg were not born into the Collective. At one point in time, they were all individuals with their own unique lives, hopes and aspirations. Two of Eleven, known in their former life as Darrohk, was one of those individuals.\nAt the height of their military career, Darrohk was a commanding officer aboard the Lhohnu - a shining jewel in the Romulan Star Empire's mining fleet. At one point in time, the Lhohnu oversaw the acquisition of more than twenty percent of the Empire\u2019s entire Dilithium reserves. Specializing in mining expeditions in some of the more tumultuous and dangerous systems in the galaxy, Darrohk and their fellow crew aboard the Lhohnu were a force to be reckoned with in the excavation business.",
