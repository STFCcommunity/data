  "description": "Born in Russia, Earth in the year 2245, Pavel Andreievich Chekov was an only child with dreams and aspirations that would eventually take him to the stars and beyond.\nAt the age of 22, Chekov was granted his first assignment when he was allocated a role among the crew of the USS Enterprise - the vessel he would come to know as home for the majority of his career. Under the command of James T. Kirk, Chekov would eventually rise to the roles of navigator and security chief of the Enterprise.\nA strong navigator with a keen sense of direction and orientation even in the most strenuous of environments, Chekov is a vitally important component of the USS Enterprise\u2019s reputation.",
