  "description": "A 24th century Ferengi, Quark was born to parents Ishka and Keldar on the planet Ferenginar. Along with his brother, Rom, the siblings enjoyed a typical Ferengi upbringing in many aspects. However, Quark would be regularly embarrassed by his mother, and teased by other children for her refusal to adapt to traditional Ferengi customs. This relationship may have played a vital role in Quark\u2019s later desires to leave Ferenginar.\n\nUpon reaching the Age of Ascension, Quark\u2019s desire to seek profit among the stars became too intense to contain. Contrary to the advice of his father, he immediately set out to seek his fortune and his place on the Latinum Stairway. It wasn\u2019t long until he purchased an apprenticeship with the District Sub-Nagus, in accordance with Ferengi By-Laws. Quark immediately shined in this role, and quickly became a \u201cgolden boy\u201d of the Sub-Nagus. However, in a moment of weakness, Quark lost everything when he enraged the Sub-Nagus by sleeping with his sister.\n\nDisgraced and tormented by his past failures and the ruination of a lucrative apprenticeship, Quark sought a means to redeem himself while also retaining a mere sliver of success. After some time as a cook aboard a Ferengi freighter, he would finally receive a chance at redemption on board the Cardassian space station Terok Nor. Here, Quark became the proprietor of Quark\u2019s Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade - more commonly known as \u201cQuark\u2019s\u201d among its discerning customers. Under his administration, Quark\u2019s became a thriving hub of recreation in the Alpha Quadrant. From the station\u2019s inception as Terok Nor, to its current iteration as Deep Space 9, weary travelers can always depend on the hospitality at Quark\u2019s to help them unwind.",
