However, she couldn\u2019t resist following in his footsteps, becoming one of the most notorious thieves and smugglers in the galaxy. \n\nWith her eventual goal to take over her father\u2019s operations, Ro is driven by ambition, rather than the ego and cynicism that drives Harry, and wants to build a sustainable empire beyond her father\u2019s schemes and vanity projects.",
