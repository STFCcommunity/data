  "description": "Horribly wounded in a tragic shuttle accident, Lieutenant Airiam was saved by an experimental procedure. Following the aftermath of the accident, Airiam received cybernetic augmentations. These enhanced her senses, allowed her to make complex decisions in nano-seconds and improved her physical strength and agility.\nThese upgrades, along with her intelligence and courage, made her a natural fit for the bridge of the USS Discovery. It was not long before Airiam rose up the ranks of Starfleet, eventually achieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander.\nThough her past will always be shadowed by her tragedy, Airiam\u2019s future remains bright.",
