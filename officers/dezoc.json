  "description": "Since the Federation\u2019s first official contact with the Borg in 2365, many humans have become assimilated by the Collective. Dezoc was a mediocre member of Starfleet, diligent and conscientious, but not talented enough to make it to the starship\u2019s bridge or any higher ranks, so the only option was to settle with the daily lower decks routine. Engineering skills kept Dezoc busy at the reactor, and for that specific reason he couldn\u2019t make it to the escape pod when the Collective attacked. \nHowever, being assimilated made Dezoc equal among other drones, where he matters just as much as others do, and even though he lost emotions, memories and any sense of individuality, there is something inside that makes him more effective and ruthless than any other drone.",
