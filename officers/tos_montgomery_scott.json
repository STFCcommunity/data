  "description": "Montgomery Scott was born in Scotland, Earth in the year 2222. A self described \u201cold Aberdeen pub-crawler\u201d, Scotty is no stranger to having his crew\u2019s back in both the good times and the bad.\nAs soon as he came of age, Scotty joined Starfleet and began his training as an engineer. From these humble beginnings, he rose to the ranks of second officer and chief engineer of the USS Enterprise - a position he diligently maintained for nearly three decades. Through his tenure as chief engineer, he garnered a well-earned reputation as a \u201cmiracle worker\u201d of sorts - when it came to the Enterprise, no issue was too big or too complicated for Scotty to handle.\nA prime authority in his field, Scotty\u2019s knowledge of Constitution-class starships eventually outgrew the knowledge of those who designed them, including Enterprise designer Lawrence \u201cLarry\u201d Marvick.",
