  "description": "Una Chin-Riley has lived with a dangerous secret throughout her Starfleet career. Masquerading as a human, Una was born Illyrian, and has reaped the benefits of genetic modification. These secret advantages have granted her improved physical acuity, heightened senses and incredible reaction times. They have saved not just her own life, but those of her crew, on more than one occasion.\n\nBy the mid 2250\u2019s, Una was serving aboard the USS Enterprise as helmsman and first officer to Captain Christopher Pike. Una would soon earn the moniker of \u201cNumber One\u201d, a name she would diligently carry in service and representation of her ship and fellow crew. Now, she sits alongside Pike on the bridge with the rank of Commander, where she leads by example.",
