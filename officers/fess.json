  "description": "The younger of the two Ferengi brothers who were mentored by Quark, Fess is a shrewd business mind, often preferring to pull the strings from the shadows. As a child, Fess was orphaned, and adopted begrudgingly by Arrock\u2019s parents. They never let him forget it, leaving a chip on Fess\u2019 shoulder. Although his timid nature has made him an easy target for the vultures of the business world, Arrock is often there to stand up for him.",
