  "description": "Born in Helsinki, Finland to an influential Starfleet dynasty, Elea M\u00e4kinen had very little say in her future. Her parents expected her to follow in their footsteps and enlist in Starfleet, to carry on the family legacy.\nIt\u2019s too bad she had no interest in it.\nElea was a natural geologist. She would spend days exploring the vast woods of her home country, searching for rare minerals or fascinating ruins. So it was to no-one\u2019s surprise that, when it came time for her to enlist, she chose instead to pursue a career in academics. Unfortunately, her family did not agree with this particular decision and elected to cut Elea off. She was left on her own, with nobody to count on but herself.\nElea took this incredible challenge in her stride, graduating top of her class. She dedicated herself to finding new materials that she could stake her claim to.\nHer expertise has made Elea adept at identifying and safely collecting rare materials. Every crew she\u2019s worked with has praised her natural leadership and immense knowledge... despite her lack of social graces.",
