  "description": "Nero is a Romulan mining ship Captain who comes from an alternate future. In his timeline's 2387, Nero witnessed the destruction of his homeworld of Romulus.\n\nThe untimely efforts of Ambassador Spock to contain the supernova that engulfed his planet resulted in the creation of an artificial black hole, which created this offshoot reality. On arrival, Nero's vessel, the Narada, was heavily damaged in combat with the USS Kelvin, leaving Nero and his crew stranded.\n\nNero lost his family when the disaster occurred and on that day, promised himself retribution against Spock for his failure.",
