  "description": "Data is a Soong-type android, the fifth of six developed by Dr. Noonien Soong. Deactivated and abandoned by his creator, he was eventually found by the USS Tripoli on Omicron Theta. With Starfleet realizing Data\u2019s potential upon reactivation, and the android searching for a purpose, he was admitted into the Starfleet Academy.\nDespite excelling scholastically, as well as in all physical examinations, Data still found himself dealing with major obstacles that threatened his Starfleet career, facing prejudice from some of the other cadets and officers, as well as struggling with the social and psychological elements of his training. However, Data is determined to overcome these challenges to become the most effective Starfleet officer he can be.",
