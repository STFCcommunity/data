  "description": "For all the obstacles thrown at him, Geordi has never let anything keep him down for long. Driven by his unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a fascination with any and all technology in the known universe, he has become one of the most skilled and respected engineers of his generation. Meanwhile, his unerring work ethic and loyalty has earned him the respect of everyone around him.\nBut aside from his prodigious abilities in his field, Geordi is often the heart of the USS Enterprise-D crew. Treating everyone with the utmost request and kindness, to the point where even Data understood what friendship meant from his bond with Geordi, he is one of the most popular officers on board the Enterprise.",
