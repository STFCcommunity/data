  "description": "When one thinks of a 'genius', they probably imagine someone very much like Paul Stamets. Trained as an astromycologist, Stamets sought to shatter conventional thinking around biology and physics. In fact, he did not believe in the concept of biology and physics as separate sciences. He believed in biology as physics. He believed that to truly advance humanity, one needed to transcend traditional wisdom and expand the borders of scientific discovery. \nTo that end, he and his research partner Straal began work on a project - A new technology that would change the galaxy as we know it. Combining astrobiology with astroengineering, they set out to create a new method of space travel, one that would utilize a renewable fuel source to send ships farther than they ever could before, at speeds no-one thought possible. \nUnfortunately, several setbacks would prevent them from reaching their full potential. However, no matter what stands in his way, no matter how many obstacles he needs to surmount, Paul Stamets will never give up on his ultimate goal... To revolutionize scientific exploration and change the galaxy for the better.",
