  "description": "Harcourt Fenton Mudd. Thief. Swindler and con man. Liar and rogue. He goes by many pejoratives, but perhaps the most accurate of them all is opportunist. For years, Mudd has made a living by trying to con and extort everyone he\u2019s ever met. \nThough he always gives different accounts of where he came from, one element of his story always remains the same\n his claims to have faced injustices that many will never know. With that chip on his shoulder, he believes in taking what he wants, and doing whatever necessary to get ahead. Whether it\u2019s ships, weapons, creatures, - as long as he can sell it, he will try to steal it!",
