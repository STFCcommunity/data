  "description": "Leonard \u201cBones\u201d McCoy was born in Georgia, USA in 2227. He studied medicine in the mid 2240s in Mississippi, where he gained a reputation as a practical joker. His steady hand and impeccable memory made him a naturally gifted doctor, and when he joined Starfleet, quickly rose through the ranks and gained a position on the flagship of the Federation, the Enterprise. There, he took on the role of Chief Medical Officer and Head of Life Sciences.\n\nMcCoy is a regular volunteer for away team excursions and has been involved in many large-scale medical operations that have saved multiple civilizations from outbreaks and serious ecological disaster.",
