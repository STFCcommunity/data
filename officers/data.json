  "description": "Although he\u2019s one of the most advanced technologies in the universe, in both his mental and physical abilities, what\u2019s most remarkable about the USS Enterprise-D\u2019s resident android officer is his humanity. Throughout his many adventures and challenges with the Enterprise crew, he has shown curiosity, a sense of humor, and even compassion. Furthermore, he often engages in the most human of hobbies, such as painting and reading.\n\nWhile many have questioned whether or not Data can be considered a truly sentient being due to being an A.I., those who know him best believe that he is truly alive, having seen first hand his growth, both as an officer and as a friend.",
