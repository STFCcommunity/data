  "description": "Zahra grew up on a frontier Federation colony, and grew up learning the value of self reliance and adaptability. She's handy with a phaser, scrappy in a fist-fights, knows a few things about picking locks, and knows how to repair a variety of starship systems. Though she officially pursued engineering, she's subbed in as added security on away teams several times.",
