  "description": "Tomalak is a Commander of the Romulan Military, and a master in surveillance, espionage, and intelligence. His affinity for deception has placed him at the forefront of Romulan operations into enemy territory, and he has played a significant role in ensuring that the Klingon Empire and Federation remain opposed.\n\nTomalak\u2019s preferred method of warfare is to lure enemies into traps, and to frame others for acts of atrocity that were carefully orchestrated to destroy their reputation. He believes strongly in tearing his rivals and enemies apart from within, rather than launching an all out attack.\n\nAs a key military mind for the Senate, Tomalak is a powerful influence on the direction of Romulan tactics and strategy.",
