  "description": "I am the beginning, the end, the one who is many. I am the Borg.\nA menacing and enigmatic creature, the Borg Queen remains a mystery for the whole Universe. She is the leader of the Collective; an emotional individual among the impassive drones, a perfect synergy of organic and synthetic. \nThe Queen exists for one purpose - protect the Collective by bringing order to chaos and exploit emotions to get what she wants. If the drones always seek the opportunity to assimilate the desired species on sight, the Queen applies her empathy skills to make beneficial alliances and gain an advantageous position. But one must never forget, that even though the Queen may look and act like a friend, she is the Borg, and sooner or later you will be assimilated.",
