  "description": "In order to dominate their enemies and claim eventual victory on the battlefield, a Klingon cannot solely rely on physical armaments such as the Bat\u2019leth and Mek\u2019leth. They must also possess the resolve to obtain glory for the Klingon Empire in the face of adversity. They must seek to eradicate those whose command would undermine the Empire\u2019s prosperity. Gowron, son of M\u2019Rel, was a living embodiment of this philosophy.\n\nRegarded as somewhat of an outsider in his early life, Gowron would often scrutinize the methods and actions of the Klingon High Council, challenging their decision-making and military strategies. His refusal to stand by and allow ineptitude to fester among the halls of the Council would eventually see Gowron take up the seat as the empire\u2019s Chancellor. Although he may not have harbored aspirations of political leadership in his youth, Gowron quickly proved to be an efficient and pragmatic politician in his newfound calling. However, the heart and combat prowess of a warrior would always remain within him.",
