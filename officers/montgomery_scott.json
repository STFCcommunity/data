  "description": "Montgomery Scott is the eccentric but brilliant chief engineer of the Enterprise. Though his early career suffered due to an incident involving a transporter experiment and Admiral Archer's beagle, he has gone on to see the Enterprise through thick and thin. His care has kept the ship functioning through the wear and tear of daily use and unexpected crises alike.",
