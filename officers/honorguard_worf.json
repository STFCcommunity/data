  "description": "Lost brother. Found.\n\nWorf, Honorguard to the High Council, and Federation representative to Kronos, has come home. Long gone is the forgotten child of the Empire, replaced by a mighty warrior with unrivalled experience among Starfleet\u2019s finest.\n\nWorf strikes a fine balance between his duty and his bloodline, as he finally sets foot on the bridge of a Klingon battleship. As this iconic hero crosses the gap between his homeworld and his orphan heritage, he becomes ever stronger. Though he does not know with certainty where his future will lure him, he relishes the opportunity to fight alongside his own kind.",
