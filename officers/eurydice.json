  "description": "Born into poverty by parents who abandoned her, Eurydice had to learn how to survive on her own from an early age, spending her early years as a pirate and scavenger.  She quickly learned that knowing the right people can help you survive anywhere, as she became a black market arbiter, setting up sellers with buyers, specializing in ships and parts, and making a living off the small profits she earned along the way. \n\nAble to read almost anyone\u2019s body language, she can be as manipulative or as straight-talking as any given deal needs her to be. Due to the cost of supporting a daughter, Eurydice tends to live payday to payday, though she harbors dreams of finding a better life for her family.",
