  "description": "Whether serving aboard Deep Space 9 under the Federation or Terok Nor, as it was known when under the Cardassians, the station\u2019s chief of security Odo stands for one thing above all else: justice. \nOdo is unlike any other individual aboard Deep Space 9. He is a Changeling, capable of shifting his shape to take on the appearance of anything or anyone, although he has never quite been able to master the human face. \nWhen he was discovered adrift in the Denorios Belt and taken to Bajoran scientists, he wasn\u2019t even recognised as a sentient species, just a fascinating gelatinous specimen. He was subjected to painful experiments until he was able to one day prove his sentience and begin a new existence in his own right.\nFor a long time, he believed himself to be the only one of his kind, and for a long time after he found out he wasn\u2019t, he may have wished otherwise.\nOdo\u2019s people, the Changelings, are the cruel, dictatorial rulers of the Dominion, implacable enemy of all \u201csolid\u201d lifeforms and the aggressors in a bloody war against the Federation and its allies in the Alpha Quadrant.\nIn the face of all that, Odo keeps his focus squarely concentrated on justice and upholding the law on his station, whether that\u2019s thwarting the mercantile machinations of small-time nemesis Quark or making sure no one can use DS9 as the middle ground for starting a civil war.\nOdo\u2019s approach to justice is as pragmatic as they come. It doesn\u2019t matter who is making the laws; all that matters is justice and fairness. He is the quintessential police officer, beholden to the law but capable of nuance and egalitarian in its application. In Odo\u2019s world, no one - no one - is above the law.",
