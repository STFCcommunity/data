  "description": "Harcourt Fenton Mudd. Many call him a thief, a liar, a rogue, a con-man. He is all of these things. But he is, above all, a survivor.\n\nArriving in our universe through a complicated series of mycellial networks, this alternate Mudd might, at first, seem similar to our own. Indeed, he is charming, quick witted and incredibly intelligent but this Mudd has one crucial differentiating factor. There is no line he will not cross.\n\nThe cruel fate he suffered at the hands of Klingon captors hardened Mudd, turning him ruthless. It showed him that there can be no room for morals in the fight for survival. This new outlook, as well as his penchant for cons and thievery, put him at odds with the crew of the USS Discovery, who have proven to be a mighty thorn in his side. Now that Mudd is here, he will do whatever it takes to make it out alive\u2026 and maybe wreak a little havoc while he\u2019s at it.",
