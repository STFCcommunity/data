  "description": "Part man, part machine, all engineer. \"Number-one-with-a-bullet systems guy,\" Ensign Samanthan Rutherford is most at home in the Jeffries tubes or with a hyperspanner in his hand. He loves nothing more than a new problem to solve, or a new concept to test. \n\nRutherford is a hard-working Starfleet officer, and a dedicated member of the Cerritos crew. He was instrumental in the Cerritos\u2019 defeat over the Pakleds at Kalla, a feat of bravery which cost him his very memory. \n\nRutherford\u2019s dedication to the Cerritos is matched only by his loyalty to his friends. Despite being born to be an engineer, Rutherford tried his hand at various jobs aboard the Cerritos all so that he could honor a commitment to watch the Trivoli Pulsar with his best friend. \n\nIn his spare time, Rutherford enjoys building working models of Starfleet vessels and stations with Tendi, making tweaks and improvements to the Cerritos\u2019 systems and creating murderous holosuite programs.",
