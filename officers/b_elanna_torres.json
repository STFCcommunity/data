  "description": "The child of a Human father and Klingon mother, B\u2019Elanna Torres spent her formative years growing up on the Federation colony Kessik IV. After her father left home while B\u2019Elanna was still young, she grew resentful of her Klingon heritage, citing it as the reason for her father\u2019s abandonment of his wife and child. After a brief tenure in Starfleet Academy, B'Elanna dropped out of her enrolment and spent a number of months in search of a different purpose. When a Bolian freighter she was traveling aboard was attacked by Cardassian forces, her life was saved by Commander Chakotay and the forces of the Maquis. This intervention motivated B\u2019Elanna to enlist in the Maquis herself, inspired by her newfound purpose to fight back against the Cardassians.\nIn 2371, the SS Val Jean, along with B\u2019Elanna and her fellow Maquis crew, was declared lost in the Badlands. In actuality, the vessel had been abducted by the Caretaker array and transported to the Delta Quadrant, along with the Federation starship Voyager. When the Val Jean was intercepted by Voyager, the Maquis crew were incorporated into Voyager\u2019s roster. B\u2019Elanna was among those assigned to the Engineering team, and was granted a provisional promotion to lieutenant junior grade.\nAlthough reluctant to accept it in her rebellious youth, B\u2019Elanna was a brilliant engineer who was capable of learning and adapting on the fly. After continuously proving herself to be an essential member of the crew, B\u2019Elanna would eventually rise to the rank of chief engineer.",
