  "description": "Worf, son of Mogh, of the house of Martok, son of Sergey of House Rozhenko, is not the Klingon he once was. These days, the slayer of Gowron, bane to the Clan of Duras, walks the path of the pacifist. Worf has reached deep inside of himself and learned that even the greatest of warriors must be able to embrace serenity and peace as much as the flames of rage. \n\nThis is a Worf who has searched his soul and come out the other side with a wiser head on his shoulders - not that it stops him from occasionally removing unwiser heads from their shoulders if circumstances demand it.\n\nAnd circumstances are complicated. Worf is still a part of Starfleet, and still has a job to do. The galaxy faces a threat it had thought long vanquished, a threat that requires the stealth and skills of the Federation\u2019s most celebrated Klingon warrior to neutralize it. But now Worf can face his enemies unencumbered by irrational anger and violence, for now he understands that in the heat of battle, the stance that yields the greatest advantage is to be centered in oneself.",
