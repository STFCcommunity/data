  "description": "Miles O\u2019Brien was born in Ireland in 2328. As a youth, O\u2019Brien\u2019s relationship with his father was somewhat turbulent. His father was disappointed when Miles enlisted in Starfleet, wishing instead that he pursue a career as a cellist. But Miles had been building ships in bottles since he was a child; a future in engineering seemed inevitable.\n\nDespite his pragmatic and practical nature, Miles O\u2019Brien has always been a magnet for trouble. From almost dying on T\u2019Lani Prime to having a 20-year prison sentence implanted in his mind, Miles O\u2019Brien has suffered. Faced with a constant onslaught of malfunctioning machines and sensitive systems to fix, he certainly has his work cut out for him. \n\nThe Chief Engineer lives with his family on Deep Space 9; his wife, Keiko, his daughter, Molly, and his son, Kirayoshi. Balancing his family life with his work as Chief Engineer of a space station is not always easy, but O\u2019Brien\u2019s commitment to his role is only exceeded by his love for his family, and he always manages to make it work.",
