  "description": "Arkady is one of the youngest officers on the Enterprise, yet is also one of the most brilliant. He can do subspace transferral calculations in his head, manage the transporter's controls like an artist, and even substitute for Montgomery Scott as the chief engineer of the Enterprise. Humble and focused on the job, Kirk and crew rely on the russian whiz kid to see them through.",
