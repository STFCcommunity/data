  "description": "When the USS Sterling went missing in action at the borders of Borg-occupied space, Cadet Gonzales was among the first crew assigned to investigate the ship\u2019s disappearance. However, it was not long before members of this search party were greeted with the same fate as the Sterling\u2019s crew - a forced, painful assimilation into the Borg Collective. Lucia Gonzales is dead. All that remains is Nine of Ten, Septenary Adjunct of Unimatrix Twelve.",
