  "description": "Empathy. Compassion. Integrity. Three qualities every good doctor should hold. When it comes to Dr. Hugh Culber, however, he doesn\u2019t just uphold these qualities... He exemplifies them.\n\nHugh decided to enrol in medical school after a chance meeting with an impressive doctor after a hiking accident. He excelled immediately, graduating top of his class.\n\nDuring the Human-Klingon war of 2256, Culber served onboard the USS Discovery as its chief medical officer. He served with his husband, Paul Stamets and was known as a man with unwavering integrity and an iron will.",
