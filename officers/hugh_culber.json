He exemplifies them.\nHugh decided to enrol in medical school after a chance meeting with an impressive doctor after a hiking accident. He excelled immediately, graduating top of his class.\nDuring the Human-Klingon war of 2256, Culber served onboard the USS Discovery as its chief medical officer. He served with his husband, Paul Stamets and was known as a man with unwavering integrity and an iron will.",
