  "description": "As one of the infamous Duras Sisters, B\u2019Etor is responsible for much unrest throughout the Klingon Empire. As the right hand of her sister Lursa, the true power behind the House of Duras, B\u2019Etor is known for being a swift hand of vengeance.\n\nDespite her reputation as a vicious warrior, B\u2019Etor has often used schemes and deception in her pursuit of glory. These characteristics have led her honor to be questioned continuously within the High Council, leading to many instances of disgrace for Duras. B\u2019Etor\u2019s true ambition is to see her sister puppeteering the strings of would-be leaders of the Klingon Empire, and she will strive for this goal by any means necessary.",
