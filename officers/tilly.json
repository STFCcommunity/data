  "description": "Don\u2019t let her awkward demeanour fool you, Sylvia Tilly is an engineering prodigy. Tilly rated herself the greatest theoretical engineer in Starfleet academy. She was so impressive, in fact, that she was fast-tracked to serve on the USS Discovery, a science vessel built to test experimental warp technology.\nTilly had always dreamed of becoming a captain, but feared that her social anxiety would hold her back. However, with the help of her good friend, Michael Burnham, she excelled in her training and was quickly promoted to the rank of Ensign by the time the Klingon war had ended.\nTilly is motivated, compassionate and thoroughly dedicated to the ideals of Starfleet. There is no doubt in the mind of anyone who has served with her that she would make a remarkable captain.",
