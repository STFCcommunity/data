  "description": "With ancestors that include Thaddius Riker, a Union Army Colonel, William Riker\u2019s family name gave him a lot to live up to. Raised by his father in the harsh Tundra of Alaska, Riker dreamed of a life in Starfleet as a child, craving adventure and excitement that Alaska simply couldn\u2019t give him.\nDespite his natural charisma and talent for decision making, his now-strained relationship with his father has left Riker with something of a rebellious streak, as he constantly clashes with his peers and his commanding officers. And with his middling performance in Starfleet Academy belying his lofty ambitions, Riker will need to shape up if he wants to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming a Starfleet Captain.",
