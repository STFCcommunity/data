  "description": "John Harrison is the identity that Section 31 placed on Khan Noonien Singh's mind after they discovered the Botany Bay; they also altered his face and appearance, to give him fewer connections to his past.\n\nWhen awakened from his long sleep, John worked with Alexander Marcus to advance Federation science and Section 31 military capabilities several generations, providing them with long-range torpedoes, superior shields, advanced phasers, and the personal transporter.\n\nEventually, Khan's own personality emerged, and he rebelled against Admiral Marcus's controls.",
