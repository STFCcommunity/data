  "description": "One of the first Klingons to experience the Borg\u2019s invasion of the Alpha Quadrant, Kras fell prey to an assimilation fleet while overseeing a routine mining expedition. Although Kras was a skilled warrior, he was unfamiliar with this formidable new enemy, and his simple mining fleet was swiftly overwhelmed by Borg forces. Kras once served an important advisory role among the Klingon Empire. Now, he speaks on behalf of the Borg, imparting their message - All will be assimilated, and resistance is futile.",
