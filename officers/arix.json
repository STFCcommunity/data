  "description": "Arix never lost his sense of patriotism, but he found the flame of vengeance burned out in him after Nero's fall. Together with Vella he journeyed to the alternate Romulus and found a world familiar yet different. His love for Vella swept him along in her scheme to end the Enterprise, but he ultimately betrayed her purpose, paving the way for Kirk and Spock to escape, and the remnants of Section 31 to acquire the last portion of red matter.",
