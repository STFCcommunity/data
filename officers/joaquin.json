  "description": "While all of the Augments show incredible levels of intelligence, none can match the engineering prowess of Joaquin. The others joke that he was born with a wrench in hand and his extensive knowledge of all things mechanical have served him well, even in this strange, new galaxy.\nLike many of his family, Joaquin is skeptical of this future they now live in. In his mind, new technology and amazing tools take away the initiative of a good engineer. Despite his doubts, he has thrown himself into his work, now that he is free to do so. He has taken a special interest in starships. After all, it is only thanks to the Botany Bay that any of them survived this long.",
