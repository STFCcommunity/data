  "description": "Hugh is perhaps the first Borg to have developed his own sense of individuality outside of the Collective. Little is known of Hugh before he became Three of Five. His life began in earnest when he was rescued by the crew of the Enterprise D and nursed back to health, despite the danger he posed. During his time on the Enterprise he gained a friend, a name and an identity.\n\nHugh came to understand the reality of assimilation, and the cruelty inherent in robbing an individual of their sense of self, and though he wished to stay with his new friends on the Enterprise, he returned to the Collective in order to protect them.\n\nHugh\u2019s newfound individuality was something the Collective had never before experienced. It spread like a virus, beginning with the Borg onboard Hugh\u2019s cube. In an attempt to stop its spread, Hugh and his companions were cut off from the Collective and left to fend for themselves.\n\nAfter his cube was briefly under the control of the infamous Lore, Hugh rose up as leader of the displaced Borg, helping the crew of the Enterprise to put a stop to Lore\u2019s nefarious plans.\n\nHugh continues to advocate for free Borg and helps to rehabilitate the lucky few who manage to escape Collective, acclimatizing them to the vibrant - but sometimes lonely - life of individuality.",
