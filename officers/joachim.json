  "description": "Joachim has been with Khan since the beginning when they were both selected for a top-secret genetic engineering experiment. Acting as a calm balance to Khan\u2019s fury, Joachim found himself acting as his friend\u2019s moral compass for many years. It was he who counseled for leniency, mercy, and kindness.\n\nJoachim\u2019s benevolent nature and merciful heart have not endeared him to the rest of the Augments. In their eyes, he is naive with the mind of a child but he has Khan\u2019s ears and so demands their respect.\n\nDespite his calm exterior, Joachim should never be underestimated. An expert in dozens of Earth\u2019s martial arts and sparring partner to Khan himself, it is rare that Joachim is caught by surprise and even rarer that he is bested.",
