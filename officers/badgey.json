  "description": "Badgey was created by Ensign Samanthan Rutherford aboard the USS Cerritos in the latter half of the 24th century. An integral component of the Rutherford Training Beta 2.5 holoprogram, Badgey was a virtual tutor designed to oversee Starfleet training exercises within the holodeck of the Cerritos. With a smile on his face and a kick in his step, Badgey was designed to be an approachable, friendly instructor for any Starfleet cadet looking to hone their skills.\n\nHowever, when the Cerritos was attacked during an encounter with a hostile Drookmani vessel, Badgey\u2019s programming became irrevocably corrupted - turning him into a murderous psychopath in the process. With his newfound proclivity for slaughter and carnage, Badgey pursued Ensigns Rutherford and Tendi across a multitude of simulated environments within the holodeck of the Cerritos. Although Rutherford was able to reactivate Badgey\u2019s safety protocols, it wouldn\u2019t be long until the two would encounter each other again.\n\nWhen the Cerritos was later ambushed by a Pakled clumpship, the crew were swiftly overwhelmed and seemed to be no match for their opponent\u2019s tactics. Rutherford was left with no alternative but to disable Badgey\u2019s safety protocols and use him as a weapon against the Pakled. In one last vain attempt to exact revenge on his \u201cfather\u201d, Badgey attempted to detonate the Pakled ship with Rutherford on board, seemingly destroying himself in the process. But it wouldn\u2019t be long until Badgey would once again emerge and prove that he will indeed \u201calways be here.\u201d\n\nEven though he may be lovable and charming on the surface, Badgey is a deranged, bloodthirsty maniac who should be avoided at all costs. Although, if he happens to find himself on board your ship, Badgey will teach you a lesson that you will never forget.",
