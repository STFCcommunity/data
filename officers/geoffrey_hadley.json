  "description": "Geoffrey Hadley is a science officer with expertise in biology, geology, and chemistry. Gregarious and curious, Hadley signed up with Starfleet to see new worlds and experience new cultures; he often chats with visitors to the ships he serves on, and his friendly demeanor makes him a friend to many. Hadley's also shown some interest in navigation and helm, though he hasn't requested transfer to the Command and Operations division as of yet.",
