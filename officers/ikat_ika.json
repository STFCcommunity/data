  "description": "Victory is life. \nFor any Jem\u2019Hadar soldier, dying in service to the Dominion is a great honor, a chance to carry out their life\u2019s greatest purpose.\nIt is an honor second only to killing in service to the Dominion.\nNo Jem\u2019Hadar knew this better than Ikat\u2019ika, the First at the Dominion\u2019s brutal Internment Camp 371. During his service aboard this floating hell, he took countless lives in his ruthless unarmed combat drills. \nIkat\u2019ika longed to find someone worthy of facing him in one-on-one combat. His opportunity came when the great Worf, son of Mogh, was brought aboard his station. Worf and Ikat\u2019ika fought long and, though Ikat\u2019ika had a distinct advantage, he could not finish off his Klingon opponent. Refusing to kill such an admirable challenger, Ikat\u2019ika defied orders, choosing to give up his own life, rather than compromise his own honor.",
