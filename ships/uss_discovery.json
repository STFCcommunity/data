  "description": "All things can be understood once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.\"\nThis was the motto of the USS Discovery when it was launched into service. Officially designated a Crossfield class science vessel, the Discovery's facilities could accommodate 300 discrete scientific investigations at any one time.\nHowever, Discovery's mission statement would change drastically after the Battle at the Binary Stars in 2256. \nWith Starfleet stretched thin and the Klingons advancing toward Federation space, Discovery was pressed into service as a warship, one that would turn the tide of the conflict. The key to Discovery's military success was its unique spore drive, which allowed it to travel galactic distances in the blink of an eye."
