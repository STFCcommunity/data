  "description": "The many corporations, leisure centers and casinos that function in the Exchange value two things above all else: security and discretion.\nTo keep their many clients and investors happy and worry-free, these conglomerates hire elite mercenaries to ensure that precious cargo is transported safely across Exchange space.\nOf course, such bounty would prove attractive to the many rogues, scoundrels and brigands across the galaxy. In order to better protect their cargo, these transports have been fitted with heavy hull plating, well capable of taking hits from even the most powerful of bandits.",
